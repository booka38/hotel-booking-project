            -The Hotel Booking Analysis report is a visual representation of
            hotel booking data. - On Top there’s a quick overview of the total
            number of Bookings, Total Revenue generated, Reservation Status,
            Number of Guests and their average stay Period.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Then the Booking Channels section provides information on the
            number of bookings by booking channel, which can help hotel managers
            determine the effectiveness of their marketing strategies and adjust
            their focus accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            -The Guest Preferences section provides information on the
            percentage of bookings by room type, such as single, double, Queen,
            Suite, etc. This information can help hotel managers identify their
            target audience and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.

            I prefer this project to be called a report more than interactive
            dashboard but you can filter the data to choose the month you need
            or If you want to compare properties using the two drop down lists
            on Top of the Dashboard “The Default Numbers shown represents all
            Properties and all months.”

            The hotel transactional page is designed for managing and your
            reservations effectively. It allows you to have a detailed view of
            the reservations, and make informed decisions to optimize the
            hotel's operations. And It contains:
          </p>
          <p>
            1.
            <span class="fw-bold">Total Guests:</span> It includes both adults
            and children to give you an idea of the occupancy level for each
            booking. <br />
            2. <span class="fw-bold">Booking Channel:</span> This column
            specifies the channel through which the reservation was made.
            <b></b> 3. <span class="fw-bold">Room Type:</span> This column
            provides information about the type of room booked for each
            reservation. It may include options such as standard rooms, deluxe
            rooms, suites. <br />
            4. <span class="fw-bold">Cost:</span> The cost column indicates the
            price associated with each reservation. It includes the total amount
            the guest is expected to pay for their stay, including any
            additional charges or fees. <br />
            5. <span class="fw-bold">Status:</span> This column displays the
            current status of the reservation. It helps you track whether a
            reservation has been completed, marked as a no-show, extended, or
            reduced. This information allows you to manage inventory and make
            informed decisions regarding room availability.

            Please note that this report aims to provide an overview of the
